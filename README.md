  **Hi**, I am a your **Friendly Hobby Coder**, that does most of the **stuff for fun**, so my code is probably **not optimal** most of the time, but thats **okay for me**.
  
  Also **while you're here** why don't you **check out** some of my **pinned reposetories** or hit me up with a **message**, if you like something or you have some feedback.
